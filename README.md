 ### 'Diabetes Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model'

### 'Overview'

### 'This repository contains the code and documentation for a final project For Epsilon AI  on predicting diabetes using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model. In this project, we have gone through various stages of the data science pipeline, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, model building, feature engineering, and scaling to create a robust diabetes prediction model.

### 'Data'
The dataset used for this project contains information related to diabetes. It includes various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, as well as a target variable indicating whether an individual has diabetes or not.

### 'Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)'
In the EDA phase, we performed data exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics. We analyzed data distributions, identified missing values, and examined correlations between features. EDA helped us gain insights into the dataset's quality and structure.

### 'Data Visualization'
Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data. We created various plots and charts to visualize the relationships between features and the target variable. These visualizations aided in feature selection and identifying patterns in the data.

### 'Model Building'
We implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict diabetes. The KNN algorithm was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness in classification tasks. We fine-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

### 'Feature Engineering'
Feature engineering involved transforming and creating new features to improve the model's predictive power. We experimented with feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for our model.

### 'Scaling'
To ensure that our features have consistent scales, we applied scaling techniques such as Standardization or Min-Max scaling. Scaling is crucial for algorithms like KNN that rely on distance-based calculations.

### 'Conclusion'
This project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a diabetes prediction model using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The project includes EDA, data visualization, model building, feature engineering, and scaling steps.
